### CPSC 120


* Lab 1

  In Lab 1 which was my first coding assignment at Cal State Fullerton, I found it very interesting
  how I implemented the string statement "Hello Bhavesh!\n". The simplicity of the code in lab 1 is what
  I really admired it as it felt like taking baby steps into the coding world. Also, being able to learn the
  Google C++ Style was very important for the rest of my labs which I was able to learn and apply to the rest
  of my coding assignments.

* Lab 9
  
  In Lab 9 part 2, I made a code that compares the philosopher's schedules to see if they matched up or not.
  The code I implemented primarily consisted of a for loop which looped through both philosopher's schedules
  and compared them using an if statement followed by a false bool to determine if their schedules do match.
  The code I implemented was very interesting to me because I had to use different methods of code to find the
  length of the schedules which helped me compare them.

* Lab 6

  In Lab 6 part 2, I was able to learn the game of blackjack and create a mini coding game of it. I found writing
  the different cards in blackjack were the most interesting to me because this was my first time learning the game and
  being able to write code using these different cards allowed me to further understand the complex components.
  Including the file "blackjack_functions.h" was also fascinating to me because I was able to see how the computer
  uses different files to make the coding space clean and organized.
